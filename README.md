# CoreMIDI-example
This is based on https://github.com/JohnGoodstadt/MidiNotes. I noticed it had some delay sending notes and I was going to fix that. However, I realized that you need to adjust quite a bit of things to make it run on modern versions of Xcode and iOS so here you go :) PS: I also pimped the design a little :D


I still haven't fixed the delay (this is gonna be tonight's project) but as I am earning quite a lot of money with my MIDI apps now I thought it would be cool to contribute a little to the open-source community, maybe enabling someone else to make lemonade (or maybe make his own MIDI app idk).

Feel free to text me about any issue you encounter, I've seen pretty much every error you could possibly get on iOS, but if your question is about the "root" project itself, please go ask John Goodstadt, can't find his website anymore but he didn't reply to me back then which is why I set this up on my own.
