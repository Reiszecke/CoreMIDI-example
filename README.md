# CoreMIDI-example
This is based on https://github.com/JohnGoodstadt/MidiNotes. I noticed it had some delay and I was going to fix it. However, I realized that you need to adjust quite a lot of things to make it run on modern versions of Xcode and iOS so here you go :) PS: I also pimped the design a little :D
