Midi Notes Lite

Last Revision:
Version 1.0, 2011-05-17
Build Requirements:
iOS SDK 4.2 - Universal App
Runtime Requirements:
iOS 4.2 or later - requires coreMidi framework


This sample application demonstrates how to receive and send midi messages to/from the coreMidi framework included in IOS from 4.2. Interface is a UITableView to log all notes captured. Click on UITableCell to send the note out.

Use this file in your own projects as you see fit.
Please email me at john@goodstadt.me.uk for any problems, fixes, addition or thanks.

================================================================================
Instructions:

open MidiNotesLite.xcodeproj and run.

================================================================================

Apple Mac OSX Simulator (iPhone or iPad)

1. Open Audio Midi Setup on OSX. Make sure MIDI window is checked (Window Menu->Show MIDI Window
2. Double click on Network (in MIDI Studio)
3. If Session box is empty click + and create a session - default is Session1
4. Run the xcode project and "iPhone Simulator" should appear in the Directory box.
5. Click Connect - this moves over to the Session box as a participant.
6. This IP address should be automatically picked up, in Midi Notes Lite in the third line of the UITableView.

7. When the above are complete you will need to generate MIDI notes. I recommend a simple software keyboard MdidKeys from http://www.manyetas.com/creed/midikeys  

8. This will generate MIDI notes on the session which the simulator will pick up.
9. Touching a UIViewCell with a midi note will send this note out.
================================================================================ 

iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch on OSX

1. Complete top 3 Items in Apple MAC notes above.
2. Run xcode project on iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch
3. Connect the new device in OSX MIDI setup box
4. See step 6 and above to test.


================================================================================

iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch and Microsoft Windows and a Midi Keyboard

1. Plug Midi keyboard into Microsoft windows (USB)
2. You will need an equivalent to OSX MIDI setup - I use Tobias Erichsen's rptMIDI - http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/rtpMIDI.html. you can also use his virtual keyboard for testing - http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/virtualKeys.html 
3. All devices should be seen in the Directory box in rptMIDI - just as in OSX's MIDI Setup.
4. The MIDI keyboard key presses will be picked up in Midi Notes Lite.

================================================================================

Code:

To use midi receive/send indoor programs use the class midi.m/midi.h that has all the coreMidi routines and many helper conversion routines.
